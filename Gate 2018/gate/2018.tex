\item The logic gates shown in the digital circuit below use strong pull-down nMOS transistors for LOW logic level at the outputs. When the pull-downs are off, high-value resistors set the output logic levels to HIGH (i.e., the pull-ups are weak). NOte that some nodes are intentonally shorted to implement wired logic. Such shorted nodeswill be HIGH only if the outputs of all the gates whose outputs are shorted are HIGH.
